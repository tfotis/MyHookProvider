MyHookProvider
==============

The purpose of this module is to serve as an example of how the new hook system works in Zikula 1.3

What this hook does is display an input field in the create/edit form of your module. The filled data in this input are validated and a response is logged. The response can then be used by your module to respond accordingly.

Check also the other example module "MyHookSubscriber" to see how the new hook system is used.
